//! Stmt module defines the [`Stmt`] enum, which represents the various statements
//! in the RAM assembly language, as well as related types [`Value`],
//! [`RegisterValue`], and [`Label`].
//!
//! The [`Stmt`] enum contains variants for each of the supported assembly language statements,
//! such as Load, Store, Add, and Jump, along with the line number from the source code.
//!
//! The [`Value`] enum represents a value that is passed to a statement. It can be either a pure value
//! or a value in a register.
//!
//! The [`RegisterValue`] enum represents a reference to a register, either directly or indirectly.
//! Direct references are register numbers, while indirect references are register numbers that
//! point to other registers.
//!
//! The [`Label`] struct is used to represent labels in the assembly language. Labels are used for
//! defining targets for jump statements.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Here's an example of RAM assembly language code:
//!
//! ```text
//! load =0
//!
//! read  0
//! store 1 # number
//!
//! sub =1
//! jz quit_1
//!
//! loop_1:
//!     load  1
//!     div   3
//!     mul   3
//!     sub   1
//!     jz quit_2
//!     load  3
//!     sub   2
//!     jz quit_1
//!     load  3
//!     add  =1
//!     store 3
//!     jmp loop_1
//!
//! quit_1:
//! write =1
//! jmp quit
//!
//! quit_2:
//! write =0
//! jmp quit
//!
//! quit:
//!
//! halt
//! ```
//!
//! This code demonstrates the use of various statements, including Load, Store, Jump, and Label.
//! It also demonstrates the use of `Value` and `RegisterValue` for specifying operands in the
//! assembly language code.
