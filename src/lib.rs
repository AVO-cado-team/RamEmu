//! The `ram` library provides a simple interpreter for a custom assembly language, which is
//! designed to work with a RAM (Random Access Memory) machine model. This library allows users to
//! parse, validate, and execute assembly code, and to perform various operations on the RAM machine.
//!
//! The library is organized into the following modules:
//!
//! - [`errors`] for error types related to parsing and interpretation.
//! - [`parser`] for parsing assembly code into an intermediate representation.
//! - [`program`] for representing and working with a program in memory.
//! - [`ram`] for the RAM machine implementation and its execution logic.
//! - [`registers`] for working with the RAM machine registers.
//! - [`stmt`] for representing and working with assembly statements.
//!
//! Additionally, the library will provide the following optional features:
//!
//! - `wasm`: Adds WebAssembly bindings for using the library in a WebAssembly environment.
//! - `serde`: Adds serialization and deserialization support for the RAM machine state.
